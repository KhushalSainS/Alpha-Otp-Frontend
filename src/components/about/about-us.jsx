              OTP scams are skyrocketing, with scammers exploiting numerical OTPs across banking and non-banking
              sectors. At AOTP, we've engineered a groundbreaking solution: Alphabetical OTPs (AOTP)â€”a cryptographically
              secure, alphabet-based OTP system exclusively for non-banking use cases like e-commerce, app logins, and
              tech support.
            </p>

            <p>
              Powered by HOTP and TOTP algorithms, AOTP leverages cryptographically secure random generation, encrypted
              storage, and real-time verification to deliver unmatched security. By distinguishing non-banking OTPs from
              banking ones, AOTP empowers users to spot and stop scams instantly.
            </p>

              Our AOTP API seamlessly integrates into existing systems, offering businesses a robust, scalable, and
              user-friendly authentication layer. With features like JWT-based encryption, bcrypt hashing, and instant
              OTP destruction, AOTP ensures end-to-end security while eliminating fraud.
